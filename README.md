## FAQ

**What is this?** This is a website for a school project that interactively collects responses to surveys from users,
and then tries to quantify their personality from that. Then, it allows users to interact with a game, and a chat,
and records responses from users as to who their favourite other person in their group was.

**Can I contribute?** No ^
